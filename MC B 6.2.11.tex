\centerline{\textbf{\Large{Introduction to Probability}}}


\vskip 0.4in

The probability of event $a$ happening is the $\#$ of favorable outcomes over the total outcomes: $P(a)=\frac{a}{total}$.

\

\

\textbf{Basic Probability}

\textit{Example:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemindent}{2em}

\item \textbf{How many ways are there to roll a 7 with two standard dice?}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Solution:} There are 6 ways to roll a 7, out of 36 total ways to roll.  The probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\vskip0.15in

\textit{Example 2:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemindent}{2em}

\item \textbf{A $4\times4\times4$ cube is painted then cut into 64 identical cubes.  Find the probability that if a random cube is selected it will have exactly 2 faces painted.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Solution:} The cubes with 2 faces painted are the cubes on the edges of the original cube.  There are 12 edges $\times$ 2 per edge = 24 cubes.  The probability is $\frac{24}{64}=\boxed{\frac{3}{8}}$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\vskip1in

\textbf{Complementary Probability}

Used in the scenario in which counting the cases that \emph{don't work} is easier:  $P(a) = 1-P($not $a)$.

\textit{Example:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemindent}{2em}

\item \textbf{What is the probability that when a coin is flipped five times, there will be at least one head?}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Solution:} $P($one head or more$)$ = $1-P($no heads$)$.  The probability that there will be no heads is $\frac{1}{32}$.  The probability that there will be at least one head is $1-\frac{1}{32}=\boxed{\frac{31}{32}}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\vskip1in

\textbf{Conditional Probability}

\hskip.5in The probability of an event $a$ while another event $b$ is already guaranteed to happen.

\hskip.5in Probability of event $a$ with condition $b$ (given $b$): $P(a)=\frac{P(a \& b)}{P(b)}$.

\
\textit{Example:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemindent}{2em}

\item \textbf{A coin is flipped 3 times.  If the first flip came up heads, what is the probability that all three flips will be heads?}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Solution:} There is only one way to flip heads all three times.  Since the first flip is heads, then there are only 4 ways for the other two flips.  The probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

\item \textbf{Division Theorem:} \hskip0.1in There is exactly one way to express each integer $x$ in the form \hskip0.03in $x = pq + r$,
where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are integers, such that $p$ is the divisor, $q$ is the quotient, and $r$ is the remainder, for which $0 \le r < q$. (In other words, division works).
\vskip0.17in

\begin{itemize} 
\item \emph{Example:}  $100 = 14\cdot 7 + 2$, or 100 days can be divided into 14 weeks with 2 days left over.
\end{itemize}
\vskip0.65in





\item \textbf{Problem 1:} \hskip0.1in  If the last day of 1996 was a Monday, what day of the week is February 23, 1997?
\vskip0.15in
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Solution:} \hskip0.1in Since December 31, 1996, is a Monday, we are trying to find the day of the week that is 31 + 23 days after a Monday.  So: 31 + 23 = 54, and $54 = 7\cdot 7 + 5$.
Therefore, 5 days after Monday is Saturday, so Feb. 23, 1997 is a Saturday.

\vskip0.32in

\centerline{\emph{But There's Got To Be a Better Way!}}
\vskip0.27in 

\centerline{Another way to do this problem is to just drop the multiples of 7} 
\centerline{under 31 and 23, and we find that there are 3 and 2 extra days respectively.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
31=4\cdot 7+3 \\
23=3\cdot 7+2
\end{align*}

\centerline{Now, we can just \textbf{\underline{add remainders}} to get 3 + 2 = 5 days more than an integral number} 
\centerline{of weeks.  So 5 days after Monday is Saturday, which makes Feb. 23, 1997, a Saturday.}

\item \textbf{Problem 2:} \hskip0.1in  The first day of the twenty-first century was January 1, 2001, which was a Monday.  What day of the week will be the first day of the twenty-second century?
\vskip0.15in

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Solution:} \hskip0.1in The longer solution is to recognize that $365\cdot 100 + 24 = 36524$, where the extra 24 represents the extra days due to the leap years (contrary to what you might think, 2100 is not a leap year). \\

\centerline{$36524 = 5217\cdot 7 + 5$, so we now have found out that a century} 
\centerline{can be divided into 5217 weeks with 5 days left over.} 
	
\vskip0.15in \centerline{Therefore, 5 days after a Monday is Saturday, so Jan. 1, 2101, is a Saturday.}

\vskip0.32in

\centerline{\emph{But There's Got To Be a Better Way!}}
\vskip0.27in 

\centerline{The much quicker way to do this problem is to just drop the multiples} 
\centerline{of 7 under 365, and we find: $365 = 52\cdot 7 + 1$.} 

\vskip0.15in
\centerline{Therefore, one hundred years will give us 5200 weeks with 100 extra days, plus} 
\centerline{an additional 24 days to account for the leap years.  Now, we can forget about}
\centerline{the 5200 weeks and just consider the 124 extra days.}

\vskip0.15in
\centerline{$124 = 17\cdot 7 + 5,$}

\vskip0.15in \centerline{so there are 5 extra days after the 17 additional weeks.  Therefore, we} 
\centerline{find much more quickly that Saturday is the first day of year 2101.} 

\vskip0.32in

\centerline{\emph{But There's Got To Be an Even Better Way?!}}
\vskip0.27in 

 
\centerline{We can even further quicken this process by recognizing that $100 = 14\cdot 7 + 2$.  So} 
\centerline{over $14\cdot 7 = 98$ years, the single extra day in every year will be grouped into 98 days} 
\centerline{or 14 extra weeks.  Therefore, now we only need to consider the 2 extra days left,}
\centerline{plus the 24 extra days from the leap years.}
\vskip0.15in
\centerline{$2 + 24 = 26 = 3\cdot 7 + 5$.}

\vskip0.35in
\centerline{\emph{Summary:}} 
\vskip0.05in

\centerline{Method 1:  $100\cdot 365 + 24 = 36524 = 5217 + 5.$}
\centerline{Method 2:  $100\cdot 1 + 24 = 124 = 17\cdot 7 + 5.$}
\centerline{Method 3:  $2\cdot 1 + 24 = 26 = 3\cdot 7 + 5$}

\vskip0.15in
\centerline{Basically, by Method 3, we \textbf{\underline{multiplied the remainders}} 2 and 1, the respective}
\centerline{remainders when 100 and 365 are divided by 7.}
\end{itemize}




\vskip0.7in
\item \textbf{Problem 3:} \hskip0.1in  Find the remainder when $23^5$ is divided by 7.
\vskip0.15in

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Solution:} \hskip0.1in Since exponentiation is really just quick multiplication, we can apply our ``multiplying remainders" rule to this problem. \\

\centerline{$23^5 = 23\cdot 23\cdot 23\cdot 23\cdot 23$, which will have the same remainder as $2\cdot 2 \cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2 = 2^5$.} 

\vskip0.15in
\centerline{Therefore, we could have replaced 23 with 2 in our computations (Do you see why?)} 
\centerline{So now we just need to compute $2^5 = 32$, and $32 = 4\cdot 7 + 4$.  Therefore, $23^5$ leaves }
\centerline{a remainder of 4 when divided by 7.   That was easy!!}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\centerline{\textbf{\Large{Modular Arithmetic}}}
\vskip0.33in

Modular arithmetic, also called mods, is a branch of mathematics used to solve for remainders when an integer is divided by another integer. In other words, it's a sleeker, more compact version of the division theorem.
\vskip0.17in


\indent \indent  \indent $-$ \emph{Definition:}  $m\equiv n \bmod{p}$ is equivalent to $\frac{m-n}{p}\in N$. In other words, $m-n$ is a multiple of $p$. \\

\vskip-0.18in \hskip1.28in For example: $53\equiv 3\bmod{5}$. Note that the symbol $``\equiv"$ is used, not $``="$. \\ \vskip-0.18in \hskip1.28in Also, note that 5 is what we call our \textbf{modulus}.
\\ \vskip-0.18in \hskip1.28in
In terms of the Division Theorem, if $x=pq+r$, then $x\equiv r \bmod p$.


\vskip0.42in

\textbf{Why we care}: Mods  have their own system of arithmetic (hence, modular arithmetic)
\vskip0.05in
\begin{itemize}
\item $a+b\pmod{n}\equiv a\pmod{n}+b\pmod{n}$
\vskip0.05in
\item $a\times b\pmod{n}\equiv a\pmod{n}\times b\pmod{n}$

\item \textbf{Find 109 mod 9}. 
\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize} 
\item We start by finding the smallest multiple of 9 less than 109.  We know 90 is a multiple of 9, so we add 18, which is another multiple of 9, to get 108, another multiple of 9. Thus, $109 \equiv 109-108\equiv 1\bmod{9}$.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Find $-$2 mod 8.} 

\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item This problem may look a bit strange at first, but thinking outside the box would definitely help. Let us subtract a negative multiple of 8:  $-2 \equiv -2-(-8) \equiv 6 \bmod{8}$.  Now we see that $-2\equiv 6\bmod{8}$.
\end{itemize}


\vskip0.2in


\item \textbf{Find the last digit of 8$\times$6$\times$7$\times$2$\times$13$\times$19.} 

\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item The last digit of an integer is the remainder when the integer is divided by 10.  Let's rewrite each of the integers in mod 10.   This still looks rather messy, so we simplify by multiplying out the negatives.  Observing the problem above, we discover that
 $8\times 6\times 7\times 2\times 3\times 9 \equiv (-2)\times(-4)\times (-3) \times 2\times 3\times (-1) \equiv 8\times 9\times 2 \equiv 4 \bmod{10}$.
\end{itemize}


\vskip0.2in

\item \textbf{Find the remainder when $3^{523}$ is divided by 13.} 
\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item We may just list powers until we find a pattern. 

Note that $3^1\equiv 3\pmod{13}$, $3^2\equiv 9\pmod{13}$, $3^3\equiv 1\pmod{13}$, and we can stop here. 

Then $3^{3k}\equiv 1\pmod{13}$ so $3^{523}\equiv 3^{522}\times 3\pmod{13}\equiv 3\pmod{13}$

\end{itemize}

\vskip0.2in

\item \textbf{Find \emph{n} such that \emph{5n} $\equiv$ 2 mod 7.} 

\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item Since mods are only defined by integers, we conclude that $n\ne \frac{2}{5}$.  We can add 7 to the right side, since $5n\equiv 2+7m \bmod{7}$, or $a\equiv b+kp\bmod{p}$, where $a$, $b$, $k$, and $p$ are integers.  Now, we get $5n\equiv 9\bmod{7}$.  Did that help much? It's debatable. (In other words, no.) Let's add more 7’s.  9 + 7 = 16.  16 + 7 = 23.  23 + 7 = 30.  Indeed, 30 is a multiple of 5.  So we have $n \equiv 6\bmod{7}$.
\end{itemize}


\vskip0.2in


\item \textbf{Find a multiple of 4 that is 9 greater than a multiple of 11.} 
\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item We rewrite this problem as $4n\equiv 9\bmod{11}$.  4 doesn't go into 9 evenly, so let's add multiples of 11 again.  Add 11 to 9 and we get 20, which is a multiple of 4.  Therefore, $n\equiv 5\bmod{11}$.
