\centerline{\textbf{\Large{Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick}}} \vskip0.1in
\centerline{\textit{SFFT for short}}

\vskip0.33in

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Tipoffs}

\vskip0.17in

\begin{itemize}
\item You have a nasty $xy$ term
\item You're solving something in integers
\end{itemize}

\vskip0.17in

\item \textbf{How it works}

\vskip0.17in

\begin{itemize}
\item Think completing the square
\item Add some constant term to make everything factor
\item Typically we start with something like $xy+3x+5y$ and end with something like $(x+5)(y+3)-15$
\end{itemize}

\vskip0.33in

\item\textbf{Find all ordered pairs of integers $(x,y)$ such that $xy+4x+3y=5$.}
\vskip0.1in

We want to make the LHS look like $(x+?)(y+?)$. 

By expanding this, we see that the first ? should be 3 and the second ? should be 4.

But then to make this work, we are missing a $3\times 4$ term so we add 12 to the original equation.

\begin{align*}
xy+4x+3y+12 &= 5+12 \\
(x+3)(y+4) &= 17
\end{align*}

Now we use the fact that $x$ and $y$ must be integers, so we can make a chart.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[t]{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$x+3$& $y+4$&$x$&$y$\\\hline\hline
1&17&-2&13\\\hline
17&1&14&-3\\\hline
-1&-17&-4&-21\\\hline
-17&-1&-20&-5\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vskip0.1in
Finally, our solutions must be $(-2, 13)$, $(14, -3)$, $(-4, -21)$, and $(-20, -5)$.

\centerline{\textbf{\Large{Modular Arithmetic}}}
\vskip0.1in
\centerline{\textit{it's just arithmetic...sort of}}
\vskip0.33in

Modular arithmetic, also called mods, is a branch of mathematics used to solve for remainders when an integer is divided by another integer. 
\vskip0.17in


\indent \indent  \indent $-$ \emph{Definition:}  $m\equiv n \bmod{p}$ is equivalent to $\frac{m-n}{p}\in N$. In other words, $m-n$ is a multiple of $p$. \\

\vskip-0.18in \hskip1.28in For example: $53\equiv 3\bmod{5}$. Note that the symbol $``\equiv"$ is used, not $``="$. \\ \vskip-0.18in \hskip1.28in Also, note that 5 is what we call our \textbf{modulus}.
\\ \vskip-0.18in \hskip1.28in
In terms of the Division Theorem, if $x=pq+r$, then $x\equiv r \bmod p$ (very important)


\vskip0.42in

\textbf{The Basics}: Mods  have their own system of arithmetic (hence, modular arithmetic)
\vskip0.05in
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.6in]
\item $a+b\pmod{n}\equiv a\pmod{n}+b\pmod{n}$
\vskip0.05in
\item $a\times b\pmod{n}\equiv a\pmod{n}\times b\pmod{n}$
\vskip0.05in
\item Subtraction exists too, with the idea of negative mods 
\vskip0.05in
\item Division sort of exists. But it's more complicated.

\item \textbf{Find 109 mod 9}. 
\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize} 
\item We start by finding the smallest multiple of 9 less than 109.  We know 90 is a multiple of 9, so we add 18, which is another multiple of 9, to get 108, another multiple of 9. Thus, $109 \equiv 109-108\equiv 1\bmod{9}$.
\end{itemize}


\vskip0.2in




\item \textbf{Find $-$2 mod 8.} 

\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item This problem may look a bit strange at first, but thinking outside the box would definitely help. Let us subtract a negative multiple of 8:  $-2 \equiv -2-(-8) \equiv 6 \bmod{8}$.  Now we see that $-2\equiv 6\bmod{8}$.
\end{itemize}


\vskip0.2in


\item \textbf{Find the last digit of 8$\times$6$\times$7$\times$2$\times$13$\times$19.} 

\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item The last digit of an integer is the remainder when the integer is divided by 10.  Let's rewrite each of the integers in mod 10.   This still looks rather messy, so we simplify by multiplying out the negatives.  Observing the problem above, we discover that
 $8\times 6\times 7\times 2\times 3\times 9 \equiv (-2)\times(-4)\times (-3) \times 2\times 3\times (-1) \equiv 8\times 9\times 2 \equiv 4 \bmod{10}$.
\end{itemize}


\vskip0.2in

\item \textbf{Find the remainder when $3^{523}$ is divided by 13.} 
\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item We may just list powers until we find a pattern. 

Note that $3^1\equiv 3\pmod{13}$, $3^2\equiv 9\pmod{13}$, $3^3\equiv 1\pmod{13}$, and we can stop here. 

Then $3^{3k}\equiv 1\pmod{13}$ so $3^{523}\equiv 3^{522}\times 3\pmod{13}\equiv 3\pmod{13}$

\end{itemize}

\vskip0.2in

\item \textbf{Find \emph{n} such that \emph{5n} $\equiv$ 2 mod 7.} 

\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item Since mods are only defined by integers, we conclude that $n\ne \frac{2}{5}$.  We can add 7 to the right side, since $5n\equiv 2+7m \bmod{7}$, or $a\equiv b+kp\bmod{p}$, where $a$, $b$, $k$, and $p$ are integers.  Now, we get $5n\equiv 9\bmod{7}$.  Did that help much? It's debatable. (In other words, no.) Let's add more 7’s.  9 + 7 = 16.  16 + 7 = 23.  23 + 7 = 30.  Indeed, 30 is a multiple of 5.  So we have $n \equiv 6\bmod{7}$.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Find all $n$ such that 6a+5$\equiv$ 3 mod 4}

\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item We can simplify it like we would a normal equation.

\begin{align*}
6a+5 &\equiv 3\bmod{4}\\
6a &\equiv 2\bmod{4} \\
2a & \equiv 2\bmod{4}
\end{align*}

However, we have to be a little careful in finishing this off, we can't just say $a\equiv 1\bmod{4}$.

Note that $2a \equiv 2\bmod{4}$ is equivalent to saying $2a=4b+2$ for some $b$.

Then $a=2b+1$, or \fbox{$a\equiv 1\bmod{2}$}, which indeed works.
\end{itemize}
\vskip0.4in

\textbf{\large{Linear Congruences}}

\vskip0.2in

Just as we have systems of equations in algebra, we have \textit{linear congruences} in modular arithmetic.
\vskip0.05in
Essentially, we are given two modular congruences and told to combine them into one.

\vskip0.1in
\item \textbf{Describe all integers $n$ that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 9 when divided by 11} 
\vskip0.08in
\begin{itemize}
\item We may write the conditions as 
\begin{align*}
n &\equiv 0\bmod{4} \\
n &\equiv 9\bmod{11}
\end{align*}

But saying $n\equiv 9 \bmod{11}$ is the same as saying $n=11a+9$ for some integer $a$.

We use this simple observation by plugging back into the other congruence to get

\begin{align*}
11a+9 & \equiv 0 \bmod{4} \\
3a+1 & \equiv 0 \bmod{4} \\
3a & \equiv 3\bmod{4} \\
a &\equiv 1 \bmod{4}
\end{align*}

Now we rewrite this in division form again and write $a=4b+1$ for some $a$. 

But originally, we wanted to describe $n$. We had $n=11a+9$, so plugging in $a=4b+1$, we get $n=44b+20$, or \fbox{$n\equiv 20\bmod{44}$}.

\vskip0.2in

\textit{Note}: This is indeed all solutions $n$. However, there are a couple of important details too technical to explain here. The technique we used above will always work if you use it correctly though.

\vskip0.1in
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prove the divisibility rule for 3.}
\vskip0.1in
\begin{itemize}
\item We actually claim that a number is always congruent to the sum of its digits mod 3.

Suppose we have some number $\overline{a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5}$.

We may expand this as $\overline{a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5}=10^4\cdot a_1+10^3\cdot a_2+10^2\cdot a_3+10\cdot a_4+a_5$

Then 

\begin{align*}
10^4\cdot a_1+10^3\cdot a_2+10^2\cdot a_3+10\cdot a_4+a_5 &\equiv 1^4\cdot a_1+1^3\cdot a_2+1^2\cdot a_3+1\cdot a_4+a_5 \pmod{3} \\

\centerline{\textbf{\Large{Powerful Powers Techniques}}}
\vskip0.4in

There are actually some more ways we can compute powers with mods that make it even easier.

\vskip0.1in

\textbf{Fermat's Little Theorem}
\vskip0.1in
\begin{itemize}
\item For every integer $a$ and prime $p$, $a^p\equiv a\bmod{p}$ 
\vskip0.05in
\item Alternatively, if $p$ does not divide $a$, $a^{p-1}\equiv 1\bmod{p}$
\end{itemize}

\vskip0.2in
\textbf{Euler's Totient Theorem}
\vskip0.1in
\begin{itemize}
\item A more general version of Fermat's theorem
\vskip0.05in
\item For relatively prime integers $a$ and $n$, $a^{\phi(n)}\equiv 1\bmod{n}$
\item $\phi(n)$ denotes the number of positive integers less than $n$ relatively prime to $n$\vskip0.05in
\begin{itemize}
\item If $n=p_1^{r_1}\cdot p_2^{r_2}\cdots p_k^{r_k}$, then $\phi(n)=n\cdot(1-\frac{1}{p_1})\cdot(1-\frac{1}{p_2})\cdots(1-\frac{1}{p_k})$
\vskip0.05in
\item For example, $\phi(20)=20\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{4}{5}=4$ and $\phi(120)=120\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{4}{5}=32$

\vskip0.4in

\textbf{Using our new tricks}
\vskip0.1in
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the remainder when $17^{17}+18^{18}+19^{19}$ is divided by 7?
\vskip0.1in
\begin{itemize}
\item Revisiting this problem with our new tricks, it gets even shorter.

First we do the simple reduction mod 7 to get
\vskip-0.1in
$$17^{17}+18^{18}+19^{19}\equiv 3^{17}+4^{18}+5^{19}\pmod{7}$$

Now since $p$ is prime, $a^6\equiv 1\bmod 7$ as long as $a$ is not $0\bmod{7}$, so

\begin{align*}
3^{17}+4^{18}+5^{19} &\equiv 3^5+1+5^1\pmod{7} \\
&\equiv 243+1+5\pmod{7} \\
&\equiv 4\pmod{7}
\end{align*}

\end{itemize}

\vskip0.2in
% 16
\item What is the remainder when $2014^{2014}$ is divided by 100?

\vskip0.1in

\begin{itemize}
\item First we reduce to $14^{2014}\bmod 100$, and then...we get stuck.
\vskip0.05in
This one's not as nice because $gcd(2014, 100)\neq 1$ so we can't just straight out apply Euler's Theorem. 
\vskip0.05in
The crucial step is that instead of taking it mod 100 directly, we take $14^{2014}\bmod 4$ and mod 25 (we have to split it into prime powers for this to work) and then try to combine these later.
\vskip0.05in
Clearly $14^{2014}\equiv 0\bmod{4}$.
\vskip0.05in
Now we want $14^{2014}\bmod{25}$. This time, we can apply Euler's theorem to note that
\vskip0.05in
\centerline{$14^{\phi(25)}\equiv 14^{20}\equiv 1\bmod{25}$, so $14^{2014}\equiv 14^{14}\bmod{25}$.} 

\vskip0.05in
This is still gross, but much easier. To minimize computation, we only compute exponents of 2.

\clearpage
$14^1\equiv 14\equiv -11\bmod{25}$

$14^2\equiv (-11)^2\equiv 121\equiv -4\bmod{25}$

$14^4\equiv (-4)^2\equiv 16\bmod{25}$

$14^8\equiv (-9)^2\equiv 6\bmod{25}$

Finally, $14^{14}\equiv 14^8\cdot 14^4\cdot 14^2\equiv 6\cdot 16\cdot (-4)\equiv 16\bmod{25}$

Now we're almost done. We know that our desired number is $0\bmod{4}$ and $16\bmod{25}$. If we work out the linear congruence, we get that the number is \fbox{$16\bmod{100}$}


\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\vskip0.4in

One other note: there is one other technique to be aware of when dealing with powers. See the following:
\vskip0.1in

\begin{itemize}
\item Find the last two digits of $9^{2016}$.

\begin{itemize}
\item We could do the trick with splitting mod 100 into mod 4 and mod 25, but that would be very tedious.
\vskip0.05in
The crucial observation is that we want $9^{2016}\bmod{100}$ and $9$ is just one less than 10. 
\vskip0.05in
Then the clever idea is to write $9^{2016}=(10-1)^{2016}$ then expand with binomial theorem.

Try and work out the details on your own, but you should get 
\vskip-0.1in
$$9^{2016}\equiv 2016\cdot 10\cdot (-1)^{2015}+1\equiv \fbox{41}\bmod{100}$$

\item Emma plays with her square unit tiles by arranging all of them into different shaped rectangular figures. (For example, a 5 by 7 rectangle would use 35 tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a 7 by 5 rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have? (2006 State Team)

\item When looking for one term, ignore the summation symbol
\item Any binomial to some power can be written out as $n$ binomials multiplied out
\item The coefficient is dependent on how many times you can make that specific like term
\item You need to "choose" enough $a$'s and $b$'s
